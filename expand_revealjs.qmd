## Introduction: The Problem

::: {.expandable}
**Don't muck up your slides with too much text!**

Problems with presentation-only slides:

-   Slides lack context after the presentation

::: {.details}
We've all experienced this: you attend a great presentation, get the slides afterward, and find they're difficult to understand without the presenter's narration. Or you prepare for a presentation, knowing that your slides must do "double duty" as both a presentation tool and a stand-alone document, and create walls of text instead of eye-catching slides.

One solution is to create two separate documents: concise slides for presenting and detailed documentation for sharing. But maintaining parallel documents can be time-consuming and error-prone, as changes to one require updating the other. Why not create one product that produces both documentation *and* slides?

-   Recreating content is tedious

Problems with hybrid presentation-documentation slides:

-   Presentation suffers so slides can serve as documents

-   "Wall of text" slides are hard to read in any setting

-   Bad for viewing (Detracts from presentation)

-   Bad for reading (just share a Word doc!)
